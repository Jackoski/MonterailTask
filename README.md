#### INTRODUCTION

Hello and Welcome, this app was made as a solution to a Monterail task for Junior Back-End Dev.

I used provided PaymentGateway instead writing one by myself to show that I'm able to cooperate with other (write my
code to already existing one), also I added some extra Api's to show that I also can do some "gateways" in Api.

#### GENERAL

##### To write this app I used:

NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB, Mongoose,

##### for testing was used:

JestJS, Supertest, Postmann.

##### App is hosted on heroku:

#### Ticket-selling platform has got some additional Api, please see documentation...
